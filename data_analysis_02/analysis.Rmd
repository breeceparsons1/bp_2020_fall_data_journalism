## Exploratory analysis
##Finding 1: Spencer

```{r}
# Here the cleaned data is grouped by sponsor, year dedicated and symbol type to give a general information surrounding the creation of these symbols

heritage_sponsors <- heritage %>%
  group_by(sponsors, year_dedicated, symbol_type) %>%
    count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

heritage_sponsors

# Here we get the count of how many total monuments each sponsor has made.
```

# The highest result is "Unknown" with 1099, but the United Daughters of Confederacy was the named sponsor with the highest number at 399.
```{r}
sponsor_count <- heritage %>%
group_by(sponsors) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

sponsor_count

```

# With the United Daughters of the Confederacy having the most, we broke down the just that sponsor the same way as the heritage_sponsors string.

```{r}
heritage_sponsors_UDC <- heritage %>%
  group_by(sponsors, year_dedicated, symbol_type) %>%
  filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy") %>%
    count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

heritage_sponsors_UDC

```

```{r}
# This string shows the total number of actual monuments from each sponsor, and arranges from highest to lowest.

# The United Daughters of the Confederacy has the most symbols classified as actual monuments.

symbol_monument <- heritage %>%
  group_by(sponsors) %>%
  filter(symbol_type == "Monument") %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

symbol_monument
```

##Finding 2: Wesley 

## This is a look into the "where" and "when" aspects of dedications and removals of monuments sponsored by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

```{r}

# Working to get a clear picture of recent dedications, here are the UDC dedications since 2010 and what state they are in.

UDC_recent_dedications <- heritage %>%
filter(year_dedicated >= "2010") %>%
filter(year_dedicated <= "2020") %>%
group_by(sponsors, year_dedicated, symbol_type, state) %>%
filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy") %>%
count() %>%
arrange(desc(year_dedicated))

UDC_recent_dedications

```


```{r}
# Working to get a clear picture of recent dedications, here are the UDC dedications since 2010 and what state they are in.

UDC_recent_removals <- heritage %>%

##Finding 4: Breece

## Description: This block will determine which states have the most United Daughters of the Confederacy symbols and specifically, monuments and how the numberâ€™s changed over time 

#Finding which states have the most UDC dedicated symbols

```{r}
states_UDC_total <- heritage %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy") %>%
  group_by(sponsors, state) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 
states_UDC_total
```

#A: GA has the most with 67, followed by NC with 48. 

#Adding a filter column to specifically look at UDC dedicated monuments 

```{r}
states_monument_total <- heritage %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(symbol_type == "Monument", sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy") %>%
  group_by(sponsors, state) %>%
  count(state) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

  states_monument_total

```

#A: Found GA had most with 62 and NC had second most with 47 

#Now, filtering the data to only include symbols that have a year_dedicated value of less than or equal to 1936, which is halfway between the lowest and highest year_dedicated value to show how the numbers have changed over time. 

```{r}
states_total_before <- heritage %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy", year_dedicated <= "1936") %>%
  group_by(sponsors, state) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

  states_total_before

```
#A: Found GA had the most still with 56 and NC next with 46.   

# Now, adding another filter column to specifically look at monuments

```{r}
states_monument_before <- heritage %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  group_by(sponsors, state) %>%
  filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy", year_dedicated <= "1936", symbol_type == "Monument") %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

  states_monument_before
```
#A: Found GA had most with 54 and NC had 45. 



##Finding 5: Jummy 

## Question: After monuments, what are the five symbols have the next most amount? And what are the states that display those symbols the most?

```{r}

# To being answering the first part of this question, we'll first create a new data set, then group, count and raange the data set by symbol_type, so that only the number of each type of symbol will display.

types_of_symbols <- heritage %>%
group_by(symbol_type)%>%
count()%>%
arrange(desc(n))

# This shows us that while Monuments maintain the highest number of symbols, Highway/Roadways, Schools, County/Municipality, Parks and Colleges are the next on the list with high numbers. No other symbols have more than 40.

types_of_symbols

```

# Our next goal here was to isolate the 5 before opening it up to discover what states displayed these symbols the most. Unfortunately, on our first attempt, "Highway / Roadway" did not display within the new filtered data set.

```{r}
top_5_symbols <- types_of_symbols %>%
filter(symbol_type == "Highway / Rooadway" | symbol_type == 
         "School" | symbol_type == "County/Municipality" | symbol_type == "Park" | symbol_type == "College")

# Unsure why Highway/Roadway is not displaying in this filter.
top_5_symbols

```
# The easiest way to now determine which states display these symbols the most is to return back to the heritage set to create data sets for each of the symbol_types that display the state. Then count by state and arrange in descending order to see which states have the most. We want to observe the top 5 and perhaps discover any correlations. 

```{r}
# Highways / Roadways -- still confused to why it displays in this filter but not in the previous filter above. There are 658 in total: 118 - SC, 105 - VA, 71 - MS, 65 - GA, NC - 63. 
highway_roadway <- heritage %>%
  select(symbol_type, state) %>%
  group_by(state)%>%
  filter(symbol_type == "Highway / Roadway")%>%
  count(state)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))

highway_roadway

# Schools -- total is 152: TX - 57, VA - 27, AL - 10, FL - 10, MS - 10
schools <- heritage %>%
  select(symbol_type, state) %>%
  group_by(state)%>%
  filter(symbol_type == "School")%>%
  count(state)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))

schools

# County/Municipality -- total is 56: TX - 25, GA - 6, AL - 5, FL - 5, MS -4
county_municipality <- heritage %>%
  select(symbol_type, state) %>%
  group_by(state)%>%
  filter(symbol_type == "County/Municipality")%>%
  count(state)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))

county_municipality

# Park -- total is 43: TX - 7, VA - 6, AL - 5, TN - 5, FL - 4
park <- heritage %>%
  select(symbol_type, state) %>%
  group_by(state)%>%
  filter(symbol_type == "Park")%>%
  count(state)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))

park

#College -- total is 40: VA - 22, AL - 3, GA - 3, LA - 3, CA - 2
college <- heritage %>%
  select(symbol_type, state) %>%
  group_by(state)%>%
  filter(symbol_type == "College")%>%
  count(state)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
