## Exploratory analysis

##Finding 1: Spencer

```{r}
# Here the cleaned data is grouped by sponsor, year dedicated and symbol type to give a general information surrounding the creation of these symbols

heritage_sponsors <- heritage %>%
  group_by(sponsors, year_dedicated, symbol_type) %>%
    count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

heritage_sponsors

# Here we get the count of how many total monuments each sponsor has made.
```

# The highest result is "Unknown" with 1099, but the United Daughters of Confederacy was the named sponsor with the highest number at 399.
```{r}
sponsor_count <- heritage %>%
group_by(sponsors) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

sponsor_count

```

# With the United Daughters of the Confederacy having the most, we broke down the just that sponsor the same way as the heritage_sponsors string.

```{r}
heritage_sponsors_UDC <- heritage %>%
  group_by(sponsors, year_dedicated, symbol_type) %>%
  filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy") %>%
    count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

heritage_sponsors_UDC

```

```{r}
# This string shows the total number of actual monuments from each sponsor, and arranges from highest to lowest.

# The United Daughters of the Confederacy has the most symbols classified as actual monuments.

symbol_monument <- heritage %>%
  group_by(sponsors, symbol_type) %>%
  filter(symbol_type == "Monument") %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

symbol_monument
```

##Finding 2: Wesley 
## Description: These blocks are meant to filter what year monuments were dedicated and removed by state.

## The first block handles the dedication years, filtering out those that are unknown, then grouping by state and year_dedicated, then listed in descending order.

```{r}
heritage %>%
  filter(year_dedicated >= "1854") %>%
  filter(year_dedicated <= "2020") %>%
  group_by(state, year_dedicated)%>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

```
## The second block handles the removal years, filtering out those that are unknown, then grouping by state and year_removed, then listed in descending order.

```{r}
heritage %>%
  filter(year_removed >= "1854") %>%
  filter(year_removed <= "2020") %>%
  group_by(state, year_removed)%>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

##Finding 3: Susannah 
## Description: This block will examine which honoree has the most monuments listed to their names of those highlighted in the data. This will then guide our questions for the Daughters of the Confederacy. Do most monuments honor generals? Or founders of hate groups?

#Take the count for each of the honorees to see which honoree has the highest number.
```{r}
most_honoree_count <- honoree_count %>%
  rename(honoree_name = 'COUNTA of feature_name') %>%
  rename(grand_total = 'X31') %>%
   select(honoree_name, grand_total) %>%
  mutate(grand_total = as.numeric(grand_total))%>%
   group_by(honoree_name) %>%
   arrange(desc(grand_total))

most_honoree_count

```
#The honorees with the most monuments are Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson and then Gen. Beauregard.

#This is a logical set of names as Lee was the lead general, Davis the president and Stonewall an extremely recognizable military leader. The most interesting leader was Beauregaurd–a general who changed his ideology later in life to fight for civil rights.

#This now leads us to ask, why were these men chosen? Political leaders, they seem to be recognizable symbols of the Confederacy. One important name not in the top four is Nathan Bedford Forest.

#Ignoring Grand Total and No specific honoree, I see that the top five honorees are Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson and Gen Beauregard.

#Now that I know which honoree has the most statues, I will see which, out of the four leaders chosen, has the most.

#Find the total for Stonewall Jackson
```{r}
stonewall_total <- stonewall_jackson %>%
    rename(state = 'COUNTA of feature_name') %>%
    rename(grand_total = 'X13')%>%
   select(`state`, grand_total) %>%
  mutate(grand_total = as.numeric(grand_total))%>%
   group_by(`state`) %>%
   arrange(desc(grand_total))
stonewall_total
```
#The grand total for Jackson is 107

#Finding the Robert E. Lee total
```{r}
lee_total <- robert_e_lee %>%
  rename(state = 'COUNTA of feature_name') %>%
    rename(grand_total = 'X13')%>%
   select('state', grand_total) %>%
  mutate(grand_total = as.numeric(grand_total))%>%
   group_by('state') %>%
   arrange(desc(grand_total))
lee_total

```
#Lee's is 4.

#Finding the Jefferson Davis Total
```{r}
davis_total <- jefferson_davis %>%
 rename(state = 'COUNTA of feature_name') %>%
    rename(grand_total = 'X14')%>%
   select('state', grand_total) %>%
  mutate(grand_total = as.numeric(grand_total))%>%
   group_by('state') %>%
   arrange(desc(grand_total))
davis_total

#The Davis total is 143
```

#Finding the Forest total
```{r}
forest_total <- bedford_forest %>%
   rename(state = 'COUNTA of feature_name') %>%
    rename(grand_total = 'X10')%>%
   select('state', grand_total) %>%
  mutate(grand_total = as.numeric(grand_total))%>%
   group_by('state') %>%
   arrange(desc(grand_total))
forest_total

```
#Forest has a total of 43
#Of the most popular leaders highlighted in the data, Lee has the most memorials, but the numbers vary greatly.


##Finding 4: Breece

## Description: This block will determine which states have the most United Daughters of the Confederacy symbols and specifically, monuments and how the number’s changed over time 

#Finding which states have the most UDC dedicated symbols

```{r}
states_UDC_total <- heritage %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy") %>%
  group_by(sponsors, state) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 
states_UDC_total
```

#A: GA has the most with 67, followed by NC with 48. 

#Adding a filter column to specifically look at UDC dedicated monuments 

```{r}
states_monument_total <- heritage %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(symbol_type == "Monument", sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy") %>%
  group_by(sponsors, state) %>%
  count(state) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

  states_monument_total

```

#A: Found GA had most with 62 and NC had second most with 47 

#Now, filtering the data to only include symbols that have a year_dedicated value of less than or equal to 1936, which is halfway between the lowest and highest year_dedicated value to show how the numbers have changed over time. 

```{r}
states_total_before <- heritage %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy", year_dedicated <= "1936") %>%
  group_by(sponsors, state) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

  states_total_before

```
#A: Found GA had the most still with 56 and NC next with 46.   

# Now, adding another filter column to specifically look at monuments

```{r}
states_monument_before <- heritage %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  group_by(sponsors, state) %>%
  filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy", year_dedicated <= "1936", symbol_type == "Monument") %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

  states_monument_before
```
#A: Found GA had most with 54 and NC had 45. 



##Finding 5: Jummy 

## In 2020, 31 monuments attributed to UDC were removed. North Carolina removed the most monuments with 11. No monument dedicated later than 1961 was removed in 2020. The year 1905 had the most monuments removed in 2020.
```{r}
#This displays the number of removals for each year within this decade.
UDC_recent_removals_total <- UDC_recent_removals%>%
  group_by(sponsors, year_removed)%>%
  count(year_removed)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))

UDC_recent_removals_total
```

```{r}
#This code shows that there were 31 total UDC monument removals in 2020.
UDC_2020_total_removals <-UDC_recent_removals%>%
  filter(year_removed == "2020")%>%
  group_by(sponsors, year_removed)%>%
  count()

UDC_2020_total_removals
```

```{r}
#This code tells what state had the most monuments removed in 2020: NC with 11.
UDC_most_removals_2020 <- UDC_recent_removals %>%
  filter(year_removed == "2020")%>%
  group_by(sponsors, state, year_removed)%>%
  count()%>%
  arrange(desc(n))

UDC_most_removals_2020
```

```{r}
#This code shows that a statue dedicated in 1961 is the latest monument dedicated that was removed in 2020.
latest_2020_removals <- UDC_recent_removals %>%
  filter(year_removed == "2020")%>%
  select(sponsors, year_dedicated, year_removed)%>%
  arrange(desc(year_dedicated))

latest_2020_removals
```

```{r}
#This one shows the year_dedicated with the most removals in 2020.
UDC_removals_year <-UDC_recent_removals%>%
  filter(year_removed == "2020")%>%
  group_by(year_dedicated)%>%
  count()%>%
  arrange(desc(n))

UDC_removals_year
```

# The questions we now raise are: 
## 1) if the high tally of removals this year can be attributed to Charleston, what can the 21 removals in 2017 be attributed to? [this is a story question]
## 2) Are there any other years with high removal numbers in the total data? [this is a data question]
## 3) Why were there no monuments dedicated later than 1961 that were removed in 2020? [this is a story question]
