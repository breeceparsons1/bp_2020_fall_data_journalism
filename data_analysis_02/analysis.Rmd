## Exploratory analysis
##Finding 1: Spencer

```{r}
# Here the cleaned data is grouped by sponsor, year dedicated and symbol type to give a general information surrounding the creation of these symbols

heritage_sponsors <- heritage %>%
  group_by(sponsors, year_dedicated, symbol_type) %>%
    count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

heritage_sponsors

# Here we get the count of how many total monuments each sponsor has made.
```

# The highest result is "Unknown" with 1099, but the United Daughters of Confederacy was the named sponsor with the highest number at 399.
```{r}
sponsor_count <- heritage %>%
group_by(sponsors) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

sponsor_count

```

# With the United Daughters of the Confederacy having the most, we broke down the just that sponsor the same way as the heritage_sponsors string.

```{r}
heritage_sponsors_UDC <- heritage %>%
  group_by(sponsors, year_dedicated, symbol_type) %>%
  filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy") %>%
    count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

heritage_sponsors_UDC

```

```{r}
# This string shows the total number of actual monuments from each sponsor, and arranges from highest to lowest.

# The United Daughters of the Confederacy has the most symbols classified as actual monuments.

symbol_monument <- heritage %>%
  group_by(sponsors) %>%
  filter(symbol_type == "Monument") %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

symbol_monument
```

##Finding 2: Wesley 

## This is a look into the "where" and "when" aspects of dedications and removals of monuments sponsored by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

```{r}

# Working to get a clear picture of recent dedications, here are the UDC dedications since 2010 and what state they are in.

UDC_recent_dedications <- heritage %>%
filter(year_dedicated >= "2010") %>%
filter(year_dedicated <= "2020") %>%
group_by(sponsors, year_dedicated, symbol_type, state) %>%
filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy") %>%
count() %>%
arrange(desc(year_dedicated))

UDC_recent_dedications

```


```{r}
# Working to get a clear picture of recent dedications, here are the UDC dedications since 2010 and what state they are in.

UDC_recent_removals <- heritage %>%
filter(year_removed >= "2010") %>%
filter(year_removed <= "2020") %>%
group_by(sponsors, year_dedicated, year_removed, symbol_type, state) %>%
filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy") %>%
count() %>%
arrange(desc(year_removed))

UDC_recent_removals

```

##Finding 3: Susannah 

Susannah Outhier
## Description: This block will examine which honoree has the most monuments listed to their names of those highlighted in the data. This will then guide our questions for the Daughters of the Confederacy. Do most monuments honor generals? Or founders of hate groups?

## Load and clean data
## Data is from the same data spreadsheet but a separate sheet

honoree_count <- read_csv("data/Honoree_Count.csv")

honoree_count
```
```{r}
most_honoree_count <- honoree_count %>%

#need to convert chr to dbl
Most_honoree_count

```
#The honorees with the most monuments are Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson and then Gen. Beauregard.

#This is a logical set of names as Lee was the lead general, Davis the president and Stonewall an extremely recognizable military leader. The most interesting leader was Beauregaurd–a general who changed his ideology later in life to fight for civil rights.

#This now leads us to ask, why were these men chosen? Political leaders, they seem to be recognizable symbols of the Confederacy. One important name not in the top four is Nathan Bedford Forest.

#Now that I know which honoree has the most statues, I will see which, out of the four leaders featured in the data due to their celebrity, has the most.
```{r}

##Finding 4: Breece

## Description: This block will determine which states have the most United Daughters of the Confederacy symbols and specifically, monuments and how the number’s changed over time 

#Finding which states have the most UDC dedicated symbols

```{r}
states_UDC_total <- heritage %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy") %>%
  group_by(sponsors, state) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 
states_UDC_total
```

#A: GA has the most with 67, followed by NC with 48. 

#Adding a filter column to specifically look at UDC dedicated monuments 

```{r}
states_monument_total <- heritage %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(symbol_type == "Monument", sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy") %>%
  group_by(sponsors, state) %>%
  count(state) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

  states_monument_total

```

#A: Found GA had most with 62 and NC had second most with 47 

#Now, filtering the data to only include symbols that have a year_dedicated value of less than or equal to 1936, which is halfway between the lowest and highest year_dedicated value to show how the numbers have changed over time. 

```{r}
states_total_before <- heritage %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy", year_dedicated <= "1936") %>%
  group_by(sponsors, state) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

  states_total_before

```
#A: Found GA had the most still with 56 and NC next with 46.   

# Now, adding another filter column to specifically look at monuments

```{r}
states_monument_before <- heritage %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  group_by(sponsors, state) %>%
  filter(sponsors == "United Daughters of the Confederacy", year_dedicated <= "1936", symbol_type == "Monument") %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

  states_monument_before
```
#A: Found GA had most with 54 and NC had 45. 



##Finding 5: Jummy 

## Question: After monuments, what are the five symbols have the next most amount? And what are the states that display those symbols the most?

```{r}

# To being answering the first part of this question, we'll first create a new data set, then group, count and raange the data set by symbol_type, so that only the number of each type of symbol will display.

types_of_symbols <- heritage %>%
group_by(symbol_type)%>%
count()%>%
arrange(desc(n))

# This shows us that while Monuments maintain the highest number of symbols, Highway/Roadways, Schools, County/Municipality, Parks and Colleges are the next on the list with high numbers. No other symbols have more than 40.

types_of_symbols

```

# Our next goal here was to isolate the 5 before opening it up to discover what states displayed these symbols the most. Unfortunately, on our first attempt, "Highway / Roadway" did not display within the new filtered data set.

```{r}
top_5_symbols <- types_of_symbols %>%
filter(symbol_type == "Highway / Rooadway" | symbol_type == 
         "School" | symbol_type == "County/Municipality" | symbol_type == "Park" | symbol_type == "College")

# Unsure why Highway/Roadway is not displaying in this filter.
top_5_symbols

```
# The easiest way to now determine which states display these symbols the most is to return back to the heritage set to create data sets for each of the symbol_types that display the state. Then count by state and arrange in descending order to see which states have the most. We want to observe the top 5 and perhaps discover any correlations. 

```{r}
# Highways / Roadways -- still confused to why it displays in this filter but not in the previous filter above. There are 658 in total: 118 - SC, 105 - VA, 71 - MS, 65 - GA, NC - 63. 
highway_roadway <- heritage %>%
  select(symbol_type, state) %>%
  group_by(state)%>%
  filter(symbol_type == "Highway / Roadway")%>%
  count(state)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))

highway_roadway

# Schools -- total is 152: TX - 57, VA - 27, AL - 10, FL - 10, MS - 10
schools <- heritage %>%
  select(symbol_type, state) %>%
  group_by(state)%>%
  filter(symbol_type == "School")%>%
  count(state)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))

schools

# County/Municipality -- total is 56: TX - 25, GA - 6, AL - 5, FL - 5, MS -4
county_municipality <- heritage %>%
  select(symbol_type, state) %>%
  group_by(state)%>%
  filter(symbol_type == "County/Municipality")%>%
  count(state)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))

county_municipality

# Park -- total is 43: TX - 7, VA - 6, AL - 5, TN - 5, FL - 4
park <- heritage %>%
  select(symbol_type, state) %>%
  group_by(state)%>%
  filter(symbol_type == "Park")%>%
  count(state)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))

park

#College -- total is 40: VA - 22, AL - 3, GA - 3, LA - 3, CA - 2
college <- heritage %>%
  select(symbol_type, state) %>%
  group_by(state)%>%
  filter(symbol_type == "College")%>%
  count(state)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
